(She just shot 'The Love Hypothesis,' he's starring in Mindy Kaling's new series.)⁠ ⁠ It's deeply hard on me to be apart from the person I love. I'm a very domestic woman, and I love to be at home and sit on my couch with my person and my dog; there's nothing that brings me greater joy than that specifically.⁠ ⁠ (📸: Getty Images, Lili Reinhart).",
