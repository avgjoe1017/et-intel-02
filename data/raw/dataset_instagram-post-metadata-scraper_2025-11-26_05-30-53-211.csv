⁠
The couple — who got engaged almost exactly one year ago — tied the knot on Sunday at The Barn at Silverstone in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The two exchanged vows in front of 180 guests, including two of his eight kids, Hannah and Collin, and her daughter, Juliana.⁠
⁠
""Before I met you, I never knew what it was like to be able to look at someone and smile for no reason,"" Jon told his new bride. ""I feel like the luckiest man in the world, because I get to grow old with my best friend and the love of my life.""⁠
⁠
​The bride wore the romantic Tasha wedding gown by Eddy K. ⁠Their first dance song? ""I Guess I'm in Love"" by Clinton Kane, the song that Jon sent Stephanie when they started dating.
⁠
Her bridal party included seven of her closest girlfriends, while his groomsmen included 21-year-old Collin, plus Jon's brothers, new brothers-in-law and closest friends. They also had a ""beer bearer"" handing out beverages to guests.⁠
⁠
The newlyweds will honeymoon next year, when they set sail on a Caribbean cruise. ⁠
